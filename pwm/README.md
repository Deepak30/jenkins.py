# Python Wrapper Maker #
*  This tool creates python wrapper (PW) classes for every descriptor and extension point out of the Jenkins source code directory.
*  E.g. for the `Builder.java` file creates a `BuilderPW.java` file, which can be used for the plugin development in Python.
* These wrappers are included in the [python-wrapper](../python-wrapper) runtime plugin.
